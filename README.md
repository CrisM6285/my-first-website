# My First Website
I made this website during my web design class in college. I made it with hmtl and css.

Semester: Fall 2018

Class: Computer Science 257 - Introduction To Web Page Design

Big update May 9, 2019
- New Dark Theme instead of bright website
- Removed a lot of code
- Implemented flex
- Added Nav, Main, and Footer to website instead of div after divs

After I learn more about HTML and CSS I will try to implement it into my first website so I can see the changes I have been making.
(I have to learn how to use GitHub more as well)
