						<p>I took an electronics college class called <strong>A+ Certification Training</strong> and learned to take apart a computer (motherboard, <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr>, <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>, Hard Drives, <abbr title="Power Supply Unit">PSU</abbr>, etc.)  I have taken apart many desktop PC's and laptops from different brands (HP, Dell, Acer, etc.).</p>
						<br>
						<p>As far as pricing goes I would need to first look at the PC or Laptop and then I would give you the price of how much it would be.</p>
