				<h2>Computer Repair at your service</h2>
				<p>Whether you are a PC gamer or just someone with a PC issue living in Los Angeles, I can provide service that'll fix the issue in no time. I have many computer tools that have fixed and cleaned other PC/Laptops in the past so I am prepared without any technical difficulties.</p>
				<p>If you need your PC/Laptop repaired I can pick it up or on some occasions I can repair the PC/Laptop on the spot.</p>
