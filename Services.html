					<p>Whether you're on Facebook or YouTube there is always side banners that are full of advertisements and sometimes you click on them by accident or curiosity and end up having viruses. I can go inside the computer's folders and scan for viruses. I can also remove any unwanted programs making your PC faster!</p>

					<h2 class="SrvcTtls">PC Heating Problems</h2>

					<p>If your computer is suddenly turning off it can mean your computer is heating up. I can take apart the computer/laptop and look inside to see if maybe a fan is disconnected or if maybe the CPU needs to have the thermal paste re-applied since it's factory date. Sometimes the machine is heating up due to not having it cleaned in years and dust have accumulated.</p>

					<h2 class="SrvcTtls">Upgrade/Replace Parts</h2>

					<p>Have you ever wanted to play a PC game like Fortnite but couldn't because your computer doesn't meet the requirements to play the game? Well if that is the case then I can take a look what components you have installed on your PC and see what can be upgraded to be able to run the newest games.</p>
					<div class="UpParts">
						<a id="Memory">&nbsp;</a>
						<h3 >Memory</h3>
						<a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TZAldTMdL._SL1500_.jpg" target="_blank">
							<img src="images/RAM.jpg" alt="RAM Sticks" title="RAM Sticks">
						</a>
						<p>If you like having 20 tabs open in your browser but it your computer can't handle it then I can add more memory for you so the computer can run faster with 20 tabs open.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="UpParts">
						<a id="GPU">&nbsp;</a>
						<h3 >GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</h3>
						<a href="http://media.gamersnexus.net/images/media/2016/systems/how-to/how-to-build-pc-gpu-2.jpg" target="_blank">
							<img src="images/GPU.jpg" alt="GPU" title="GPU">
						</a>
						<p>Want to run games and programs faster then upgrading a Graphics card will help you with that and I can install it for you.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="UpParts">
						<a id="CPU">&nbsp;</a>
						<h3 >CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h3>

							<img src="images/CPU.jpg" alt="CPU" title="CPU">
						</a>
						<p>I can check what motherboard you have on your PC and I can add a better CPU if needed.</p>

						<a id="HD">&nbsp;</a>
						<h3 >Hard Drives</h3>
						<a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-XZNr7mS0iw/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">

						<p>Running out of space? Then I can add either a HDD or if you want something more faster but a bit more pricey then a SSD is the way to go.</p>
